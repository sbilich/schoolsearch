Description of Performance command:
  All flags are case-sensitive:

  Factor flags = {Grade, Teacher, Bus}

  If no factor flag is specified then "Grade" is used as a default.

  Grade = output the average GPA for students in each grade
  Teacher = output the average GPA for students being taught by each teacher
  Bus = output the average GPA for the students on each bus route

  Optional flag = {List}
  *note: the flag must be listed after the factor flag, it cannot precede it.

  List = specifies in addition to outputting the average GPA for each element of
          a particular factor, also list the students associated with each
          calculated average.
